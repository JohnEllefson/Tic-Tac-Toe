# Overview

This is a simple 2 player Tic-Tac-Toe program. I created this program as an exercise to better re-familiarize myself with C++ and it's syntax.

# Future Work

- Allow the game to save the current game's board to a file.
- Allow the game to read in a pre-existing tic-tac-toe board from a file.
- Find a better symbol to make up the horizontal lines of the board to be consistent with the vertical lines.
